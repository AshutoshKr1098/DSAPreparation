1. Sorting Definitions
-----------------------

Sorting is a way to arrange elements in increasing/decreasing manner based on some criteria.
For ex: Let's have an array : 2,5,8,6,10

if we sort it on the basis of value in increasing order : 2 5 6 8 10
if we sort it on the basis of no. of divisors: 
2-2
5-2
6-4
8-4
10-4

therefore sorting will be 2 5 6 8 10

Properties to look for while sorting
------------------------------------
1. Time complexity
2. Space complexity
3. Stability ( order of equi-valued elements in non sorted array remains same in sorted array)
4. recursive/iterative
5. inplace / extra memory needed


Main Sorting Algos to look for (list might get updated in future)
-------------------------------
1. selection sort
2. insertion sort
3. bubble sort
4. quick sort
5. merge sort
6. heap sort
