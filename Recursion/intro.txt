# Important Points About Recursion 

### Intro ###

1. To check whether a problem is recursive or not, you have to see whether we have any choice in that function.
   If we have choices, then can we make decisions on those choices. 

2. On making decisions, our input with reduce on it's own. And this is what recursion is, breaking a larger 
   problem into smaller. We take decisions and reduce the input domain and thus the problem. 

3. To represent a recursive decision diagram, we make use of recursive tree. This is built using input output 
   method. We get final answer at the leaf of our decision tree. 

4. A classical problem to begin with in visualizing recursion is Subset problem. In subset problem, for every 
   character, we have a choice of selecting/rejecting it. And on the basis of choice we can move further.
