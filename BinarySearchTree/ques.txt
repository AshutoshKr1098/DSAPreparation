1. Validate BST -> solved using inorder traversal and range comparison. TC:O(n) SC: O(n)
2. range Sum -> solved using postorder traversal. Though the question is leetcode easy, it took me good 
                amount of time to come up with solution.
                Need to solve using typical BST property.
3. lcaInBST -> solved considering tree's nodes are unique, keys present [then used property of lca and bst]
4. kthSmallest -> to be solved more efficiently(and also a variation where bst is getting modified)
