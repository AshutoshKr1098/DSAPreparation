A heap data structure can be of 2 types: Min heap and max heap. 

#problem identification

1. Kth
2. Smallest/Largest
3. You will want to sort it and then return the answer. 

# Benefits

We reduce the sorting time from NlogN to NlogK. We always maintain a restriction in space, and dont consider anything 
beyond K. 

#How heap works?

Heap will always have the top element as either max of all or min of all. And the same goes true recursively for
each parent node in subtrees.

#How to code using heap?

make use of STL's built in priority_queue.
