4. path sum [https://leetcode.com/problems/path-sum/] - preorder traversal
5. path sum2 [https://leetcode.com/problems/path-sum-ii/] - preorder
6. sum root to leaf numbers [https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-root-to-leaf-numbers/] -preorder
7. lonely node [https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-the-lonely-nodes/] - level order traversal

Date: 6th April 2021

1. Second minimum node in a binary tree -> level order traversal + keeping track of both minimums.
2. subtree of another tree -> created a sub function that matched with T, and in S, whenever we found a subroot
   having same value as T's root, pass S's subroot and T to that sub function
3.Lowest common ancestor of a binary tree -> Solved using recursion.

Date: 7th April 2021

1. Lowest common ancestor of a binary tree continued... [solving using all methods]
2. Solved find path from root to any node using preorder traversal (code in 1.TreeBuilding...)
3. Solved LCA-2 on leetcode using solution from geeksforgeeks
4. Attempting All nodes K distance in binary tree [https://leetcode.com/problems/all-nodes-distance-k-in-binary-tree/]
   update: problem solved using the approach I planned in 1 go wohooooo!!!!! but time and space taken is too much
   Need to optimize it further.
